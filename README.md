## About

Simple command-line NPM executable for figuring out a website's hosting provider.

## Prerequisites

You will need `chromedriver` installed and available on your `PATH` variable, as this package relies on the Chrome browser.

## Installation

Make sure you have the latest Node and NPM (I am using Node v9.11.1), then:

```bash
npm install -g whoishost
```

## Usage

```bash
whoishost
```

You will be prompted for a site as input. Once you have entered, press **ENTER** and it will log to console when it has found a match.
